I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Jyväskylä and am a software developer with a robust foundation in software development. My goal is to become an experienced Full Stack Developer. My expertise comes from my academic background, hands-on personal projects, and practical work experience.

I have a year of professional experience in software development, both the public and private sectors. My experience has been within agile development teams of 7-10 members, where collaboration and iterative progress are key.

My main programming languages are Java (with Spring Boot), JavaScript, and TypeScript. My practical skills include test automation development with Robot Framework, using Docker, and working with CI/CD pipelines.

Currently, I am expanding my skill set by learning about DevOps with Kubernetes and cloud technologies, aiming to integrate these capabilities into my full stack development tech-stack.
